            This article particularly focuses on the importance of form structure. Survey exhaustion often occurs due to poor form layout and information architecture. 

            Some notes of interest for me were the importance of asking the important questions first and creating a single column. Both of these tasks reduce cognitive load on the user and the survey is more likely to be completed. 

            I particularly enjoy <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/welcome?welcomeStep=hdyhau" target="_blank">Duolingo's</a> onboarding due to the simplicity in questions, use of mascot to guide, and the progress bar at the top. These aspects make the experience more immersive.
